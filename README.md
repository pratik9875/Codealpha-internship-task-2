## ✅ TASK 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This task focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis** on the Kaggle Books Dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and data quality before visualization.

### 🔍 1. Asking Meaningful Questions
Before analysis, I framed key questions such as:
- Which book categories have the most books?
- What are the highest-rated and lowest-rated books?
- How are prices distributed across categories?
- Are ratings correlated with price?

### 📂 2. Exploring the Data Structure
Using Python and Pandas, I analyzed:
- Number of rows and columns  
- Data types of each variable  
- Missing values  
- Duplicate records  
- Summary statistics (mean, median, max, min)

### 📊 3. Identifying Trends, Patterns & Anomalies
Through visual and statistical exploration:
- Found variation in prices across categories  
- Detected rating distribution patterns  
- Identified outliers in pricing  
- Observed category-level trend differences

### 🧪 4. Testing Hypotheses
Examples:
- **Hypothesis:** Higher-rated books are more expensive  
- **Observation:** After analysis, the correlation was weak  
- **Hypothesis:** Some categories consistently have higher average ratings  
- **Result:** Verified through grouping and visualization

### 🚨 5. Detecting Data Issues
During EDA, I identified:
- Missing values in some columns  
- Inconsistent price formatting  
- Unbalanced category distribution  
- Rating stored as text instead of numeric  

These issues were cleaned during preprocessing before Power BI visualization.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV dataset from Kaggle**

---

This EDA helped prepare the dataset for the final **Power BI dashboard**, ensuring the data was clean, consistent, and analysis-ready.
